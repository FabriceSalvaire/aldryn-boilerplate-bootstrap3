Welcome

The most advanced **django-cms** based boilerplate for rapid development. It uses the full potential of the
`Bootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com/>`_ framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.
In addition we implement various `best practices <http://aldryn-boilerplate.readthedocs.org/en/latest/general/best-practices.html>`_ from within the front-end community.

This boilerplate is compatible with `Aldryn`_.

The latest stable versions is available on GitHub - https://github.com/aldryn/aldryn-boilerplate
