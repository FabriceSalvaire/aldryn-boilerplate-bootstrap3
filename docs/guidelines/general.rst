There are global guidelines which affects every module, those are:

.. admonition:: Standards
    :class: `important`

    - **Validate** your code through the awesome `W3C <http://validator.w3.org/>`_ services
    - There is something called `Accessibility <http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/>`_
    - Don't forget about **HiDPI**, **Retina** and **High Resolutions** displays
    - Proper fallbacks should be available if a connection is slow or features are disabled
    - Progressive enhancement, graceful degredation and responsive design are buzzwords you care about
    - Develop modular and extensible
    - Documentations is your friend

.. admonition:: Spacing
    :class: `important`

    - Use **4 spaces** for intendation

not 2, 3 or 8 – no tabs – if you are able to do 3 :sup:`3/4`, thats good enough

.. admonition:: Line Length
    :class: `important`

    - Don't breach **120 lines** of code

not even for html, we even encourage you to use 80 lines

.. admonition:: Naming
    :class: `important`

    - **lowercase**, **camelCase** or **hpyhened separation** ar all good, **no special characters** except for
      underscore ``_``, we love that one
    - Always use full words instead of shorthands, ``number`` instead of ``nr``
    - `BEM <https://bem.info/>`_ is a nice methodology to be aware of

“There are only two hard things in Computer Science:
    cache invalidation and naming things
    – Phil Karlton”

.. admonition:: Quotes
    :class: `important`

    - We use **double** ``"."`` quotes for everything and for JavaScript **single** ``'.'`` quotes
