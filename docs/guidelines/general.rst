There are global guidelines which affects every module, those are:

.. admonition:: Standards
    :class: `important`

    - **Validate** your code through the awesome `W3C <http://validator.w3.org/>`_ services
    - There is something called `Accessibility <http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/>`_
    - Don't forget about **HiDPI**, **Retina** and **High Resolutions** displays
    - Proper fallbacks should be available if a connection is slow or features are disabled
    - Progressive enhancement, graceful degredation and responsive design are buzzwords you care about
    - Develop modular and extensible
    - Documentations is your friend

.. admonition:: Spacing
    :class: `important`

    - Use **4 spaces** for intendation

not 2, 3 or 8 – no tabs – if you are able to do 3 :sup:`3/4`, thats good enough

.. admonition:: Line Length
    :class: `important`

    - Don't breach **120 characters** per line

not even for html, we even encourage you to use 80 characters per line. Yes, screens have gotten much bigger over the
last few years, but your brain has not. Better to use screen estate for splits, anyway.

.. admonition:: Naming
    :class: `important`

    - **lowercase**, **camelCase** or **hyphened separation** are all good, **no special characters** except for
      underscore ``_``, we love that one
    - Always use full words instead of shorthands, ``number`` instead of ``nr``
    - `BEM <https://bem.info/>`_ is a nice methodology to be aware of

“There are only two hard things in Computer Science:
    cache invalidation and naming things
    – Phil Karlton”

.. admonition:: Quotes
    :class: `important`

    - We use **double** ``"."`` quotes for everything and for JavaScript **single** ``'.'`` quotes
