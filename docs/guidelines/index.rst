There are global guidelines which affects every module, those are:

.. admonition:: Standards
    :class: `important`

    * **Validate** your code through the awesome `W3C <http://validator.w3.org/>`_ services
    * There is something called `Accessibility <http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/>`_
    * Don't forget about **HiDPI**, **Retina** and **High Resolutions** displays
    * Proper fallbacks should be available if a connection is slow or features are disabled
    * Develop modular and extensible
    * Documentations is your friend

.. admonition:: Spacing
    :class: `important`

    * Use **4 spaces** for intendation

not 2, 3 or 8 – no tabs – if you are able to do 3 :sup:`3/4`, thats good enough

.. admonition:: Line Length
    :class: `important`

    * Don't breach **120 lines** of code

not even for html, we even encourage you to use 80 lines

.. admonition:: Naming
    :class: `important`

    * **lowercase**, **camelCase** or **hpyhened separation** ar all good, **no special characters** except for
      underscore ``_``, we love that one

“There are only two hard things in Computer Science:
    cache invalidation and naming things
    – Phil Karlton”
