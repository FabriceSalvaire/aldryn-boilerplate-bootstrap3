Configuration
=============

.. note::

    The boilerplate ships pre-configured and runs out of the box if the :doc:`installation` steps are followed
    properly. Though most of the parts can be freely configured.


WYSIWYG
-------

The CMS allows for custom style sets within the editor. This allows the user to choose certain presets or colours. We
already added the general Bootstrap utilities. The file can be found within ``/static/js/addons/ckeditor.wysiwyg.js``
