The following software should be installed on your system in order to use this boilerplate:

* Sass: http://sass-lang.com/
* Compass: http://compass-style.org/
* Bootstrap: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass

You can compile/watch using ``compass watch private`` from within the root.


Optional
--------

We provide some automation using the `Gulp <http://gulpjs.com/>`_ task runner.
You will need the following requirements in order to use it:

* Node JS: http://nodejs.org/
* Node Package Manager: https://www.npmjs.org/
* Gulp JS: http://gulpjs.com/

After all requirements are met, install the packages using the ``npm install`` command from within the boilerplate's

You can run **Gulp** commands from within your base folder using ``gulp``. If you would like to
run specific tasks, consult the **gulpfile.js** within the base folder.
